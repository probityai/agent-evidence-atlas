# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. The most useful contributions are a
reproducible evidence run for the Open Evidence Lab and a correction to a
recorded claim. Each has an issue form: **Evidence run** and **Evidence
correction**. Fill in the source revision, the exact command and the result, so
anyone can rerun it.

## Before you open a pull request

Run `pytest` from the repository root. A change to a recorded claim or a run
links the source it rests on. A change to what a check accepts comes with a test
that fails without it.

## License

Contributions are accepted under the repository's license,
[Apache-2.0](LICENSE), per section 5 of that license. There is no contributor
license agreement to sign; the one thing asked beyond the license is the
sign-off below.

## Signing off your commits

Every commit in a pull request carries a sign-off: a line at the end of the
commit message, in the name and email of the commit's author.

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>

The line certifies the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO): that you wrote
the change or otherwise have the right to submit it under this repository's
license, and that the record of your contribution is public. `git commit
--signoff` (or `-s`) adds the line.
