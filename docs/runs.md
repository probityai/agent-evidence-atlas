# Find a retained run

Choose a run to inspect its original [report, provenance and contract](lab/register.json). Each record keeps its own claim results, roles and limits. A passed claim does not establish that every claim passed or that someone independently operated the workload.

Search by a project, claim, role or limit. The result filter shows records that contain the selected per-claim token. It does not give a run an overall grade. Without JavaScript, every record remains below and in the [Markdown page](runs.md).

Use the [Open Evidence Lab](lab.md) for the submission protocol and review process. Use [Experiments](experiments.md) for procedures and [the claim ledger](claims.md#retained-run-navigation) for sources.

### Limits

- Producer-selected compact original retains native source/library/call bytes; full preparation weights/source/dependency wheels remain privately archived and provider-expiring.
- Two separately declared preparation attempts, initial failure before inference and corrected preparation; cumulative transfer is not one 512MiB budget.
- Author tasks/answers exposed; blocked interleaving and cache reset do not make a representative benchmark or independent operation.
- Whole-process CPU and shared lifetime RSS are not per-task allocations; no live decision effects.

answerExposure: Author-written tasks/controls and expected outcomes exposed; not blind.

comparisonOrder: Native output and comparison emitted and published together; public Atlas retention before indexing does not establish a blind or raw-result-first comparison.

### Limits

- Voluntary/peer/log-import/software-only predicate with incomplete scope and unknown typed collection health.
- Native schema-v2 metadata does not carry written bytes or write count; nine-byte content comes from separate snapshots and declared workload.
- Same operator controls generated fixture, key, store, clock and captures; no independent custody, principal authentication or outside adoption.
- Selected Linux x86_64 ptrace metadata only; no mmap/io_uring attribution or absence-of-intermediate-write claim.
- Native learn/check producer PASS is a separate outside-interval same-byte calibration, not authority, collection health or task quality.
- Release source/binary association is pinned but Rust build reproducibility is not established.

### Limits

- Format/schema correctness separate from typed-exact target correctness; each model/cap/decoder/family row retained independently.
- Protocol/compiler/grammars frozen before inference; selected integer-length, key-order and spacing restrictions limit generalization.
- Exposed author tasks and same-operator native execution; no representative benchmark, live protected decision effects or independent custody.
- Four separately declared preparation envelopes; cumulative transfer exceeds one512MiB envelope.
- Original compact native provider archive retains sources/grammars/outputs and resources; full preparation weights/source/wheels remain privately archived.
- CPU is whole-process delta and RSS shared lifetime peak; not per-model/task allocation.

### Limits

- Actual framework-free installed0.0.2→0.0.3 upgrade and selectedhostpolicy run, not a new inference experiment.
- Verified scoped-report publication separate from held policy1/6 correctness, no dispatch or recovery authority.
- Full original2268member provider artifact retained including previous upgrade, wheels, immutable fixture packets and rawgate streams; no omissions.
- Same operator selects installation/reader/policy/expected outcomes; no registry release, outside recurring use or independent custody.
- Consumer source/reviewed commit and actualnative192 producer source/run remain separate.

answerExposure: Author-written tasks/controls and expected outcomes exposed; not blind.

comparisonOrder: Native output and comparison emitted and published together; public Atlas retention before indexing does not establish a blind or raw-result-first comparison.

### Limits

- Author-operated installed0.0.3-to0.0.4 reader and host-selected publication/quality policy; no new inference.
- Public selected capsule omits native packet duplicates and unrelated earlier workflow results; hashes cannot recreate omitted bytes.
- The complete provider original is retained separately; native compact archive and preparation originals have their own retention records.
- Evidence verification and complete measurement are distinct from selected quality acceptance, action authority, recurring outside adoption and independent effect custody.

answerExposure: Author-written cases, targets and host quality thresholds exposed; not blind.

comparisonOrder: Original CI execution and comparison emitted together. Selected raw Atlas retention precedes indexing at dc54f604d90278fc41c730313ffa9310a18d7ebc; it does not establish blind or independent comparison.

### Limits

- Finite authored CPU policy task; schema validity does not imply policy correctness.
- Installed review performs no model calls and grants no action authority.
- Same operator source-bound readback; outside producer acceptance, recurring adoption and independent effect custody remain unestablished.
- Public retention preserves all native packet members; full weights, dependency wheels, source archive and CI installed environment remain outside this capsule. Their hashes cannot reconstruct omitted bytes.
- Provider retention expiry is recorded; separate same-operator retention is not independent custody.

answerExposure: Authored policy inputs and targets exposed; vocabulary intervention informed by previous 384-call results; not blind.

comparisonOrder: Native inference follows frozen protocol, source-bound controls and protected merge; Atlas raw retention precedes indexing at e1122b6c08915207921ca575d98115cea4790062. Same-operator replay does not establish independent custody.

- Atlas retains the entire compact native provider artifact, not the complete preparation artifact containing model weights, wheels, archive and installed environment; hashes cannot reconstruct omitted bytes.
- Provider artifact expiry is disclosed; durable author-held Git bytes do not establish independent effect custody, outside acceptance or recurring adoption.
- Atlas validation reads data only and performs no new inference or installation of packet code.

answerExposure: Authored inputs, targets and thresholds exposed; prospective new study follows earlier 384/128-call findings; not blind.

comparisonOrder: Prospective protocol and reviewed source precede the protected Observer main execution; exact native provider bytes are retained additively in Atlas afterward. Neither raw retention nor replay establishes independent execution.

### Limits

- Two runtimes repeat the same 1,223 identities; populations remain separate.
- Parsed serialization, strict raw parsing and signed serialized receipt verification remain separate.
- The 42 parsed acceptances on raw-refusal rows include profile differences; they are not all duplicate losses.
- RFC 8785 and opt-in I-JSON numeric and Unicode policies differ; all 23 strict-parser policy rows remain retained.
- Selected licensed first-party source is retained separately from native output. Registry packages restore from integrity lockfiles; Node and Rust runtimes are not vendored.
- Author-operated conformance; separately proposed APS dependency and formal pre-run study confirmation remain separate.

answerExposure: Frozen public conformance expectations and authored receipt controls were exposed before implementation.

comparisonOrder: Native outputs and comparisons were emitted together; original archives and selected source were published before Atlas indexing.

### Limits

- Three finite three-turn cases on each fully qualified execution; resumability disabled.
- Actual ADK framework with a fixed public BaseLlm script, no provider inference or model-quality measurement.
- The LRO write is a same-author host completion, separate from the native start-only tool body.
- Two distinct Observer/witness keys remain author-held PEER custody with author-operated storage and clock.
- Actual Verify event_absence/v1 covers the six plugin-delivered native turns; whole-second projections retain original fractional timestamps separately.
- First failed reader attempt and intermediate correction remain separate original archives.
- The older 16-row comparison remains pinned separately; the prospective eight-task implementation-owned study has not started.
- Restore the originally empty denied-workspace directory before installed-reader replay; no file bytes change.

answerExposure: Fixed public model responses, authored controls and expected outcomes were exposed before execution.

### Limits

- Finite conformance inputs and exposed expected answers; no task or workload experiment.
- Six executions on two Go runtimes repeat the same 1,263 case identities: two final-PR, two branch-push and two merged-main runs; each stays separate.
- Go accepts objects or arrays; number samples use declared array wrappers, admitted scalar roots refuse separately.
- RFC 8785 and I-JSON policies differ; bare Go outcomes remain separate from admission policy.
- The original native archives retain source and reports. Installed executable hashes are recorded, but executables and the full installed runtime are outside those provider archives.
- The upstream multi-gigabyte number benchmark was not selected.

answerExposure: Public fixture expectations and finite controls were available before implementation.

comparisonOrder: Native outputs and comparisons were emitted together; all four originals were byte-retained before Atlas indexing.

### Limits

- Run records state SECOND_IMPLEMENTATION, EXTERNAL operator and NOT_INDEPENDENT; under REMORA's rule they support REPRODUCED, not EXTERNALLY_VERIFIED.
- Authorization signatures use a public test-only HMAC key created and checked by the reader; no REMORA-issued authorization is authenticated.
- The effect hash rule is unsupported until the contract defines its preimage; no frozen case uses it.
- Fixture premises such as revocation visibility at presentation and the observed field values are taken as supplied.
- No production safety, authority, independent effect custody or lifecycle change follows from these records.
